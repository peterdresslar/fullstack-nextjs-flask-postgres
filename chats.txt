Hi, claude, everything seems to be up and running smoothly, but I would like to alter my front end to demonstrate communication with my backend. I do not want to make many changes (none to the api, if possible.) What can you suggest?

---

great job, though i note that the message from the api is already wrapped in tags.

---

nailed it, thanks! I guess we need a space between the "Message from API:" label and the span, if we are being particular.

---

didn't work! Maybe (I hate to say it) an `&nbsp;`??

[NEW CONTEXT, DATABASE]

---

All, right Claude, I want to add a persistence layer to this database, simply using Vercel postgres. We will connect to it using flask, so sqlalchemy seems to be the correct approach. We can also do a small migration to build the database. The connection string is already in .env. Our demonstration table can contain an ID and timestamp of the migrations (that is to say, we create a table with two columns called migrations. when we create or run a migration we will create a new row with an autoincremented integer id and a new timestamp). Then, in the client, under our hello world message from the api, we should have a text field (it can start out by saying "loading") that says: "Most recent database migration: [ID], [xxx] seconds ago." Will you kindly lay out some code for that please?
